Please ingest the file "order_process.xes", add artificial start and end activities, retain only those cases in which the activity "Check Order" occurs at least twice, and further restrict the log to traces whose events all fall between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023. On this filtered log discover a process tree with the inductive miner (use the default noise settings), convert the tree into a BPMN model and save it as "order_model.bpmn". Finally, print the average cycle time of the resulting log expressed in days, list every activity together with its mean service time expressed in hours, and enumerate all activities that are executed in resource batches of three or more instances, showing for each of them how many such batches have been detected. I need the solution as a runnable pm4py script.
