Please load the XES event log file “claims_2024.xes”, add artificial start and end activities, and keep only those traces whose events all occurred between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2024 and whose total duration does not exceed sixty days. From this filtered log (i) list the ten most frequent trace segments found by PrefixSpan together with their absolute frequencies, (ii) restrict the log further to the prefixes up to and including the first occurrence of the activity Approve Claim, (iii) discover both a frequency‑based and a mean‑performance directly‑follows graph and save each of them as a PNG file named “dfg_freq.png” and “dfg_perf.png”, (iv) mine a Petri net with the Alpha Miner, compute the stochastic language of the log and of the model and print the Earth Mover’s Distance between the two, (v) output the overall average cycle time of the restricted log expressed in days, the position distribution of the activity Review Claim within traces, and the set of witnesses for every activity whose minimum self‑distance is finite, and finally (vi) store the discovered Petri net to disk as “claims_2024_model.pnml”.
I need the whole solution as a runnable pm4py script.
