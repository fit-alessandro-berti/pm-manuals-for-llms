Please take the object‑centric event log contained in “furniture_factory.jsonocel”, treat objects of type order as the cases and flatten the log accordingly. Before flattening, drop duplicate events, make sure the remaining events are consistently ordered in time, keep only those executions whose whole life‑cycle falls inside the calendar year 2022 and that involve at least two related objects of type component, and finally insert artificial start and end markers. On this filtered log (i) discover a Petri net with the ILP Miner, (ii) verify whether the resulting net is a sound WF‑net and, if it is not, compute its maximal decomposition and report how many sub‑nets you obtained, (iii) calculate the alignment‑based fitness and precision together with the percentage of traces that fit perfectly, (iv) mine a temporal profile and perform conformance checking with ζ = 2, printing the first five case identifiers that exhibit at least one temporal deviation, and (v) save a visualization of the Petri net to “furniturepn.png” and the net itself to disk as “furniture_model.pnml”.
I need everything as a runnable pm4py script.
