Could you please load the event data in "insurance_claims.csv", prepare it as a traditional event log, keep only those cases that begin with "Receive Claim" and finish with "Send Final Letter", whose total throughput time does not exceed ninety days, and then (i) discover a Petri net with the Inductive Miner using a noise threshold of 0.20, (ii) compute the token-based-replay fitness, the alignment-based precision and the percentage of fitting traces, (iii) list every activity whose minimum self-distance is at most 1 together with the number of cases in which that rework appears, and (iv) save the resulting model to disk as "claims_model.pnml".
