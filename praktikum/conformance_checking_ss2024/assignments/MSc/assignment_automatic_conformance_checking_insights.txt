Automatic Conformance Checking insights in Celonis
Conformance Checking is a set of techniques belonging to the Process Mining discipline to compare the behavior of an event log against a de-jure or automatically discovered model to identify anomalies and propose optimizations for the process.
Celonis provides a rapid-growing software platform for process mining, enabling complex analyses on huge datasets. With the purpose of finding further development scope for conformance checking on big datasets, the following assignment is proposed.
Some insights can be inferred from the control-flow/data/time perspective without the need for any input from the user. This helps in identifying deviations and anomalies across multi-perspective processes and rank them along with their supposed seriousness.
We aim to exploit automatic insights for conformance checking in Celonis. Therefore, the students connecting to the platform using Pycelonis or other libraries need to prepare some PQL statements to get the required information from the data models and scripts/applications to elaborate them for the analysis. In particular, some of the following patterns can be considered as they are important for conformance checking:
- The temporal profile between any couple of activities. If there are significantly different occurrences in comparison to mainstream behavior, they could be identified.
- Declarative constraints, such as always-before, always-after, never-together, the number of activities occurrences, help identify the instances with a behavior that is different from the standard one.
- Resource-based patterns (activities repeated by different resources, segregation of duties, resource-activity performance, deviations in the work pattern, identification of batches).
The group of students needs to provide a comprehensive set of techniques for automatic insights in conformance checking, including the set of PQL queries and the developed scripts/applications.
