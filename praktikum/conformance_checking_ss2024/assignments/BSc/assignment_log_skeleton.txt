Log Skeleton: an approach for declarative
conformance checking
A log skeleton is a declarative process model that has been
introduced with understandable rules that are useful to classify a
trace in the language of a process model.
The goal of the group of students is to understand, master, and
develop the concept of the log skeleton, exploring both existing and
new techniques to make it an even more valuable approach.
In particular, starting from the PM4Py python process mining library,
different goals to highlight are:
  - The production of a visualization of the log skeleton model.
  - The conversion of the log skeleton model to a Petri net with
    inhibitor and reset arcs.
  - The implementation of an alignments algorithm given an event
    log and a log skeleton model (find the best match between the
    two).
  - The creation and implementation of a standard to
    import/export log skeletons (JSON or XML based).
  - Filtering based on log skeleton.
An essential point of the project is developing a web interface that
accepts an event log and shows a visualization of the log skeleton
model, its conversion to Petri net, and the alignment results.
Moreover, it should be possible to export the log skeleton from the
interface.
The outputs of the project are:
   The code that implements the chosen subset of functionalities.
   Documentation about the product (including the requirements
    engineering).
   Tests (manual, unit)
