Implementation of Process Mining Visualizations for Conformance Checking
Conformance Checking is a set of techniques belonging to the Process Mining discipline to analyze the compliance of the executions of a business process.
The students are asked to implement some static visualizations as an extension of the PM4Py process mining library for Python (or the PM4JS process mining library for Javascript). These visualizations should provide insights into the conformance issues of a process. The visualizations could start from the output of traditional conformance checking techniques starting from a Petri net model (i.e., token-based replay or alignments) or by the scores given by automatic anomaly detection algorithms or provide insights without starting from the output of any of the aforementioned techniques.
In particular, the following techniques can be considered:
- Dotted chart and performance spectrum (already available in pm4py)
- Temporal Behavior Patterns (TBP) Chart: this chart aims to visualize the temporal patterns of the process behavior. The X-axis represents time (e.g., hours of the day, days of the week), while the Y-axis shows the frequency of a certain behavior (e.g., starting a process instance, executing an activity). The color or size of a dot on the TBP chart can be used to denote the frequency of the corresponding behavior. Such a visualization could reveal temporal conformance issues such as process instances predominantly starting at unusual times.
- Conformance Heatmap with Concept Drift Over Time (CHCD Chart): this is an extension of the traditional heatmap, where color intensity indicates the degree of conformance. However, in this chart, an additional dimension is added to represent time. It allows the tracking of conformance over time and can help identify concept drifts in the process.
- Activity Interaction Network (AIN): this visualization takes into account both the order and the frequency of activities in a process instance. It represents activities as nodes in a network, with edges representing transitions between activities. Edge thickness and color could represent frequency and conformance score, respectively. AIN provides a perspective on how activities interact with each other, and where deviations occur most frequently.
- Semantic Conformance Word Clouds: this visualization technique uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques on event labels or additional text data from the process log to create word clouds, where the size of the word represents its frequency and the color indicates its conformance (with non-conforming words being highlighted).
- Sequence Embedding Conformance (SEC) Visualization: using sequence embedding techniques (like Word2Vec but for process sequences), this visualization plots each process instance (trace) in a lower-dimensional space (2D or 3D). The distance between instances in this space would then represent their similarity, and the conformance of each instance could be represented by color or size.
The students should provide the Python project extending pm4py. In particular, every implemented visualization should be stored in an image format such as .png
It is not required to provide a graphical user interface to the user. The provision of the aforementioned library is sufficient.
