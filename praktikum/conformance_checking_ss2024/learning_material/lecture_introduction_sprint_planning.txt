Introduction to Sprint Planning
Sprint

Definition
A sprint consists in an incremental update of a product in order to introduce new
features, correct bugs or improve the documentation. In the SCRUM methodology,
each sprint has a duration of two weeks.

• Sprint goal: a sentence describing the goal of the increment.

• Sprint backlog: a set of tasks extracted from the product backlog that are useful
  to reach the goal.

• Product backlog: the set of tasks executed on the product (including the tasks
  worked in all the sprints)

Trello

Important elements of a task
• The assignee: the resource(s) responsible of the task  MUST

• The expected time duration of the task (hours)  MUST

• The reporting on the actual time spent on the task when it is done  MUST

• A clear title of the task  MUST

• A clear description (>= 50 words) of the task  MUST

• Category of the task (e.g. frontend, backend) using different colors.

• The link with the item(s) of the requirements engineering

Trello

Time assignation for the tasks
• 100% of the time available for the first sprint can be pre-allocated (no time
  needed for backlog in bug fixes or missing features …)
• 80% of the time available for the second sprint can be pre-allocated (some bug
  fixes are expected from the first phase)
• 50% of the time available for the third sprint can be pre-allocated.

• Divide the tasks according to your personal capabilities in the given time interval,
  assuming that every member of the group would contribute the same number of
  hours at the end.




                                                                                         15
Product/Sprint Backlog



The product backlog and also the sprint backlog can be modified on-the-fly if the
initial estimations or set of tasks was wrong.
Ideally your estimations skills should improve by knowing better each other.




                                                                                    16
SCRUM methodology

Important people
Product owner: has the final word about the product backlog and on the fact that
the goal of a sprint is reached.
SCRUM master: manages the collaboration inside the team, by ensuring that
everyone has what is needed to complete the tasks and acting if this does not
happen.
Developers: manage the development, test and documentation of the products.




                                                                                   17
Practical information

How to approach a sprint

• End the requirements engineering document.

• Create the product backlog (Trello).

• Create the sprint backlog of the first sprint (Trello) in the first two days after the
  submission of the requirements engineering.

• Develop, document, test and push everything in the Github/Gitlab repositories.

• The documentation should at least contain:
  • Succint description of the increment happened during the SPRINT
  • How to launch the prototypal product at this stage and which features can be immediately
    used.

• Upload the phase review to the Moodle activity.
